**Answer:** Ethics.
**Explanation:** Ethics is the branch of philosophy that explores moral principles. It's the systematic study of what is right and wrong, and how people should live their lives.

**Question 2:** What does the field of ethics aim to provide a systematic account of?
**Answer:** Morality.
**Explanation:** Morality refers to the set of principles and values that guide an individual's or society's sense of right and wrong. Ethics is the formal study of these moral principles.

**Question 3:** What are the rules and principles regulating the behaviour of individuals called?
**Answer:** Morals.
**Explanation:** Morals are the specific, established rules of conduct that people live by. For example, "do not steal" is a moral rule.

**Question 4:** Normative ethics is concerned with standards for what?
**Answer:** Right and wrong behavior.
**Explanation:** Normative ethics is the branch of ethics that focuses on establishing norms or standards for moral conduct. It asks questions like "What should I do?" or "What makes an action right?"

**Question 5:** In a restrictive sense, what are Right Actions synonymous with?
**Answer:** Obligatory actions.
**Explanation:** An obligatory action is something you are morally required to do; it is your duty. In this strict sense, the only truly "right" actions are the ones you *must* perform.

**Question 6:** What type of actions are morally required and not optional?
**Answer:** Obligatory actions.
**Explanation:** These are actions that are a moral duty. Failing to do an obligatory action is considered morally wrong.

**Question 7:** What type of actions are impermissible, meaning one is morally required not to do them?
**Answer:** Forbidden actions.
**Explanation:** These are actions that are morally wrong and must not be performed.

**Question 8:** What type of actions are good and admirable but not obligatory?
**Answer:** Supererogatory actions.
**Explanation:** These actions go "above and beyond" the call of moral duty. For example, risking your life to save a stranger is admirable but not morally required.

**Question 9:** Actions that are "not forbidden" fall under what category?
**Answer:** Permissible actions.
**Explanation:** A permissible action is any action that is not morally wrong. This includes actions that are obligatory (you must do them) and those that are morally neutral.

**Question 10:** What kind of actions are neither obligatory, forbidden, nor supererogatory?
**Answer:** Morally neutral actions.
**Explanation:** These are actions that have no moral significance. For example, choosing what color shirt to wear is morally neutral.

**Question 11:** Moral norms are commonly held to be what, meaning they apply to and bind everyone in similar circumstances?
**Answer:** Universal.
**Explanation:** Universality is the idea that moral principles should apply to everyone, in all relevantly similar situations, without exception.

**Question 12:** Moral norms are what, meaning they are formulated without the use of proper names?
**Answer:** General.
**Explanation:** This means that moral rules are stated in general terms (e.g., "All people should be treated with respect") rather than referring to specific individuals.

**Question 13:** What source of authority posits that moral authority stems from God's commands?
**Answer:** Divine Command Theory.
**Explanation:** This is the belief that morality is determined by the commands of God. An action is right because God commands it.

**Question 14:** What source of authority links morality to inherent facts about human beings?
**Answer:** Natural Law Theory.
**Explanation:** This theory suggests that morality is based on the natural order of the world and human nature. Reason allows us to discover these natural moral laws.

**Question 15:** What source of authority grounds moral principles in practical reason, independent of desires?
**Answer:** Rationalism.
**Explanation:** Ethical rationalism is the view that moral truths can be known through reason alone, not through emotion, tradition, or divine revelation.

**Question 16:** What source of authority links morality to human feelings such as sympathy or compassion?
**Answer:** Sentimentalism.
**Explanation:** This theory claims that moral judgments are founded on our feelings and emotional responses. We know something is wrong because it feels wrong.

**Question 17:** What type of value requires no external explanation for its goodness?
**Answer:** Intrinsic value.
**Explanation:** Something has intrinsic value if it is valuable in itself, not for what it can get you. Happiness is often considered to have intrinsic value.

**Question 18:** What type of value depends on some factor external to it?
**Answer:** Extrinsic value.
**Explanation:** Something has extrinsic value if its worth comes from its relationship to something else that is valuable. Money has extrinsic value because of what it can buy.

**Question 19:** What type of value is derived from what it brings about or its consequences?
**Answer:** Instrumental value.
**Explanation:** This is a form of extrinsic value. Something has instrumental value if it is useful as a tool or "instrument" to achieve a desired outcome.

**Question 20:** Which conception of "The Good" consists of an individual's subjective states, such as pleasure or desire satisfaction?
**Answer:** Subjective conception.
**Explanation:** This view holds that what is "good" is based on personal, internal states like pleasure or happiness. It varies from person to person.

**Question 21:** Which conception of "The Good" requires meeting a further standard beyond subjective states, such as acquiring genuine virtues?
**Answer:** Objective conception.
**Explanation:** This view argues that what is "good" is based on objective standards that exist independently of our personal feelings, such as knowledge, virtue, or excellence.

### **II. Ethical Lenses**

**Question 22:** What are rights defined as?
**Answer:** Justified claims or entitlements.
**Explanation:** A right is a principle that entitles a person to a certain freedom or protection. For example, the "right to life" is a claim to be protected from being killed.

**Answer:** Dignity and autonomy.
**Explanation:** This perspective emphasizes that every person has inherent dignity and the autonomy (self-rule) to make their own choices, which must be respected.

**Question 24:** Which perspective focuses on the distribution of benefits and burdens among stakeholders?
**Answer:** The Justice perspective.
**Explanation:** The Justice lens is concerned with fairness and ensuring that resources, opportunities, and punishments are distributed in an equitable way.

**Question 25:** According to the Justice perspective, why might treating people equally still be unfair?
**Answer:** Because it may ignore their different needs or circumstances.
**Explanation:** Sometimes, fairness requires treating people differently to account for disadvantages or special needs. For example, providing extra support to a student with a disability is fair, even if it's not "equal."

**Question 26:** Which ethical lens focuses on the conditions required in order for all members of a society to flourish?
**Answer:** The Common Good lens.
**Explanation:** This perspective asks us to consider policies and actions that benefit society as a whole, such as public education, healthcare, and safety.

**Question 27:** Which ethical lens focuses on the character traits (reflected in habits) that we deem good?
**Answer:** The Virtue lens.
**Explanation:** Virtue ethics is less about rules and more about the kind of person we should be. It focuses on developing virtuous character traits like honesty, courage, and compassion.

**Question 28:** Which ethical lens asks how we might excel in fulfilling a particular role or relationship?
**Answer:** The Virtue lens.
**Explanation:** Virtue ethics also considers the virtues associated with specific roles, like being a good doctor, a loyal friend, or a responsible parent.

**Explanation:** This perspective prioritizes empathy, compassion, and the responsibilities that arise from our relationships with others. It emphasizes caring for the vulnerable.

**Question 30:** What three elements of stakeholders does Care ethics consider?
**Answer:** Their needs, vulnerabilities, and relationships.
**Explanation:** Instead of applying abstract rules, care ethics looks at the concrete situation of individuals, focusing on who needs care and what our relationships require of us.

**Question 31:** The question, "How can we create the conditions required in order for all members of a society to flourish?" aligns with which lens? [cite: 33, 34]
**Answer:** The Common Good lens.

**Question 32:** The question, "How can we best protect and respect the moral rights of those affected?" aligns with which lens?

**Answer:** The Care Ethics lens.

### **III. Utilitarianism and Consequentialism**

**Question 34:** Utilitarianism is a prominent example of which kind of moral theory?
**Answer:** Consequentialism.
**Explanation:** Consequentialist theories judge the morality of an action based on its outcomes or consequences. Utilitarianism is the most famous example.

**Question 35:** Teleological theories define what first?
**Answer:** The good.
**Explanation:** Teleological (from Greek *telos*, meaning 'end' or 'goal') theories first determine what is good (e.g., happiness) and then define right actions as those that maximize that good.

**Question 36:** What is the Core Principle of utilitarianism articulated as bringing about?
**Answer:** The greatest good for the greatest number.
**Explanation:** This is the central idea of utilitarianism: a moral action is one that maximizes overall happiness or well-being for the largest number of people.

**Question 37:** What is the "good" to be maximised in classical utilitarianism generally defined as?
**Answer:** Happiness or pleasure.
**Explanation:** Classical utilitarians like Bentham and Mill identified the ultimate "good" as happiness, defined as pleasure and the absence of pain.

**Question 38:** What key aspect of utilitarian calculation ensures everyone counts equally?
**Answer:** Impartiality.
**Explanation:** Utilitarianism requires that in calculating the greatest good, everyone's happiness counts equally. No one's happiness is considered more important than anyone else's.

**Question 39:** Which early figure defended the utilitarian doctrine based on sentimentalist meta-ethics, alongside David Hume?
**Answer:** Francis Hutcheson.
**Explanation:** Hutcheson was an early philosopher who proposed that the best action is one that "procures the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers."

**Question 40:** What type of utilitarianism requires the agent to strive for the greatest overall happiness in every specific action?
**Answer:** Act Utilitarianism.
**Explanation:** This version says you should assess each individual act based on its consequences to see if it produces the most good.

**Question 41:** What is Direct Utilitarianism also known as?
**Answer:** Act Utilitarianism.
**Explanation:** It's called "direct" because the principle of utility is applied directly to the action itself.

**Question 42:** What type of utilitarianism achieves desirable consequences by following general rules?
**Answer:** Rule Utilitarianism.
**Explanation:** This version says we should follow general rules that, if everyone followed them, would lead to the greatest overall good, even if a specific action might break the rule.

**Question 43:** What is Indirect Utilitarianism also known as?
**Answer:** Rule Utilitarianism.
**Explanation:** It's called "indirect" because the principle of utility is applied to rules of conduct, not directly to individual acts.

**Question 44:** Which philosopher believed that overall utility is maximised when society relies on non-utilitarian "secondary principles"?
**Answer:** John Stuart Mill.
**Explanation:** Mill argued that we should generally follow common-sense moral rules (like "don't steal") because they tend to promote happiness, rather than calculating the consequences of every single act.

**Question 45:** What type of hedonism focuses solely on the amount or duration of pleasure?
**Answer:** Quantitative Hedonism.
**Explanation:** This view, held by Jeremy Bentham, argues that the value of a pleasure is determined only by its quantity (how long it lasts, how intense it is). All pleasures are of equal quality.

**Question 46:** Which philosopher explicitly advocated for quantitative hedonism as the only sound basis for moral rightness?
**Answer:** Jeremy Bentham.

**Question 47:** What type of hedonism posits that some pleasures are inherently higher in quality than others?
**Answer:** Qualitative Hedonism.
**Explanation:** This view, held by John Stuart Mill, argues that intellectual and moral pleasures (like reading poetry) are superior in quality to purely physical pleasures (like eating).

**Question 48:** Which philosopher proposed qualitative hedonism?
**Answer:** John Stuart Mill.

**Question 49:** What concept did Henry Sidgwick famously articulate regarding the potential conflict between rational egoism and utilitarianism?
**Answer:** The Dualism of Practical Reason.
**Explanation:** Sidgwick noted a conflict between what is rational for an individual to do for their own happiness (egoism) and what is rational to do for the happiness of all (utilitarianism).

**Question 50:** What does the utilitarian perspective seek to maximize besides overall well-being?
**Answer:** Utility.
**Explanation:** "Utility" is the technical term for the good that is being maximized, which can be defined as happiness, well-being, or the satisfaction of preferences.

### **IV. Deontological Ethics**

**Question 51:** Deontological theories define the right independently of what?
**Answer:** The good (or consequences).

**Question 52:** Deontology focuses on what two concepts as central to determining the rightness of actions?
**Answer:** Duties and rules.
**Explanation:** Deontologists believe that morality is about following a set of moral rules and fulfilling one's duties.

**Question 53:** What kind of 'ought' do deontological theories often posit?
**Answer:** A categorical 'ought'.
**Explanation:** A categorical ought, or imperative, is an unconditional command. It tells you what you must do, no matter what your personal goals or desires are (e.g., "You ought not to lie," period).

**Question 54:** What is the Core Principle of Kant's ethics, which a morally worthy action must align with?
**Answer:** The Categorical Imperative.
**Explanation:** This is Immanuel Kant's supreme principle of morality. It's a test for determining whether an action is morally permissible.

**Question 55:** What is Kant's "universal law" formulation associated with?
**Answer:** The Categorical Imperative.
**Explanation:** One version of the Categorical Imperative states: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law." In short: could your rule for action be a rule for everyone?

**Question 56:** According to Kant, persons are to be treated as what, not merely as means to an end?
**Answer:** Ends in themselves.
**Explanation:** This is another formulation of the Categorical Imperative. It means we must respect the inherent dignity of every person and not use them simply as tools to achieve our own goals.

**Question 57:** What term describes the will when it is driven by external factors like inclinations?
**Answer:** Heteronomous will.
**Explanation:** A will is heteronomous when its choices are determined by something outside of reason, such as desire, emotion, or external authority.

**Question 58:** What term describes the will when it is guided by morality and gives the law to itself?
**Answer:** Autonomous will.
**Explanation:** An autonomous will is self-governing. It chooses to act based on moral laws that it gives to itself through reason. For Kant, this is the basis of human dignity.

**Question 59:** What is the core principle of W. D. Ross's deontology?
**Answer:** There are multiple, distinct prima facie duties.
**Explanation:** Ross argued against Kant's single principle, suggesting instead that we have several fundamental moral duties (like fidelity, justice, and beneficence) that are self-evident.

**Question 60:** What are duties that are obligatory "unless there is some countervailing consideration" called?
**Answer:** Prima facie duties.
**Explanation:** A prima facie duty is a duty that is binding unless it is overridden by a more important duty in a specific situation. For example, the duty to keep a promise might be overridden by the duty to prevent harm.

**Question 61:** Ross's approach is what, recognizing multiple, distinct ultimate moral principles?
**Answer:** Pluralistic.
**Explanation:** Ethical pluralism is the view that there are several moral values or principles that cannot be reduced to a single master principle (like utility or the Categorical Imperative).

**Question 62:** Contractualism, as defined by T. M. Scanlon, concerns actions forbidden by principles that rational persons could not reasonably do what to?
**Answer:** Reject.
**Explanation:** Contractualism holds that an act is wrong if it would be forbidden by a set of rules for general behavior that no one could reasonably reject as a basis for informed, unforced agreement.

**Question 63:** Contractualism emphasizes a mutual recognition of what we owe to each other as what kind of beings?
**Answer:** Rational beings.
**Explanation:** The theory is grounded in the idea of mutual respect among rational beings who are trying to find principles they can all agree to live by.

**Question 64:** What type of theory requires value to be honoured or respected (e.g., respect for rational nature)?
**Answer:** Deontological theory.
**Explanation:** Deontological theories are about honoring values like justice, rights, and respect for persons, rather than promoting good consequences.

### **V. Virtue Ethics**

**Question 65:** Virtue Ethics primarily focuses on what type of evaluation?

**Question 71:** Plato argued that virtue requires the cooperation of which parts of the soul?
**Answer:** Reason, spirit, and appetite.
**Explanation:** For Plato, virtue is a state of harmony in the soul, where the rational part guides the spirited (emotional) and appetitive (desirous) parts.

**Question 72:** What state involves a well-ordered soul with reason controlling non-rational desires, according to Plato?
**Answer:** Justice (in the soul).
**Explanation:** Plato saw justice not just as a social concept, but as an internal state where each part of the soul performs its proper function in harmony.

**Question 73:** Aristotle defined Happiness (Eudaimonia) as activity that exercises what well?
**Answer:** Reason (or virtue).
**Explanation:** For Aristotle, happiness is not a feeling but an activity—the activity of living virtuously and exercising one's rational capacities excellently.

**Question 74:** Aristotle's Virtue of Character is a state involving election, lying in a mean, and defined by what?
**Answer:** Practical wisdom (phronesis).
**Explanation:** Aristotle's famous "Doctrine of the Mean" states that virtue is a midpoint between two extremes (vices). For example, courage is the mean between cowardice and rashness. Practical wisdom helps find that mean.

**Question 75:** According to Aristotle, for whose sake are virtuous actions chosen?
**Answer:** For their own sake.
**Explanation:** A truly virtuous person does the right thing not for some external reward, but because it is the right thing to do.

**Question 76:** What is a right action understood as, according to virtue ethics?
**Answer:** What a virtuous agent would characteristically do in the circumstances.

**Question 77:** Which school of thought identified happiness with virtue, viewing it as the only good?
**Answer:** Stoicism.
**Explanation:** The Stoics believed that virtue is the only true good, and that external things like health, wealth, or pleasure cannot make a person truly happy or unhappy.
