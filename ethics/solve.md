### **I. Foundational Ethics & Terminology**

**1. What is the philosophical study of morality broadly understood as?**
* **Answer:** Ethics.
* **Explanation:** Ethics is defined as the philosophical study of morality. It is also referred to as "moral philosophy".

**2. What does the field of ethics aim to provide a systematic account of?**
* **Answer:** Morality as a normative system.
* **Explanation:** The goal of moral theorizing within ethics is to provide a structured, systematic account of morality as a system that sets standards for behavior.

**3. What are the rules and principles regulating the behaviour of individuals called?**
* **Answer:** Ethics.
* **Explanation:** A fundamental definition of ethics is the set of rules and principles that govern the behavior of individuals in a specific context.

**4. Normative ethics is concerned with standards for what?**
* **Answer:** Right conduct and moral evaluation.
* **Explanation:** Normative ethics is the branch of philosophy that deals with establishing standards for what makes actions right or wrong and provides guidance for moral decision-making.

**5. In a restrictive sense, what are Right Actions synonymous with?**
* **Answer:** Obligatory.
* **Explanation:** While "right action" can broadly mean any action that isn't wrong, in a more restrictive sense it refers specifically to actions that are morally required or obligatory.

**6. What type of actions are morally required and not optional?**
* **Answer:** Obligatory Actions.
* **Explanation:** An obligatory action is one that a person is morally required to perform. Failure to do so is considered morally wrong. These are often understood as *prima facie* duties, meaning they can be overridden by more compelling considerations.

**7. What type of actions are impermissible, meaning one is morally required not to do them?**
* **Answer:** Forbidden Actions.
* **Explanation:** Forbidden actions are those one has a moral duty to avoid. Performing them is morally wrong.

**8. What type of actions are good and admirable but not obligatory?**
* **Answer:** Supererogatory Actions.
* **Explanation:** These are actions that go "above and beyond" the call of duty. They are morally good and praiseworthy, but a person is not blamed for not performing them (e.g., risking your life to save someone).

**9. Actions that are "not forbidden" fall under what category?**
* **Answer:** Permissible Actions.
* **Explanation:** The category of permissible actions is broad and includes anything that is not morally forbidden. This encompasses actions that are obligatory, supererogatory, and morally neutral.

**10. What kind of actions are neither obligatory, forbidden, nor supererogatory?**
* **Answer:** Morally Neutral Actions.
* **Explanation:** These are actions that carry no moral weight and are of no ethical consequence, such as choosing to eat an apple instead of an orange.

**11. Moral norms are commonly held to be what, meaning they apply to and bind everyone in similar circumstances?**
* **Answer:** Universal.
* **Explanation:** Universality is a key feature of moral norms, suggesting they should apply equally to all people in relevantly similar situations.

**12. Moral norms are what, meaning they are formulated without the use of proper names?**
* **Answer:** General.
* **Explanation:** Generality means that moral principles are stated in general terms and do not refer to specific individuals or rigged descriptions.

**13. What source of authority posits that moral authority stems from God's commands?**
* **Answer:** Divine Authority.
* **Explanation:** This view, often associated with divine command theory, grounds the authority of moral rules in the will or commands of God.

**14. What source of authority links morality to inherent facts about human beings?**
* **Answer:** Human Nature.
* **Explanation:** This perspective argues that morality is founded upon essential features of what it means to be human. For example, ethical egoists might ground morality in the fact that humans are naturally self-interested.

**15. What source of authority grounds moral principles in practical reason, independent of desires?**
* **Answer:** Reason.
* **Explanation:** Theories like Kantian ethics propose that moral principles are founded in reason itself. A rational agent, by their very nature, is guided by a rational will.

**16. What source of authority links morality to human feelings such as sympathy or compassion?**
* **Answer:** Sentiments/Emotions.
* **Explanation:** Sentimentalist theories, associated with philosophers like David Hume, argue that morality originates from human feelings, such as our capacity for sympathy or a "moral sense".

**17. What type of value requires no external explanation for its goodness?**
* **Answer:** Intrinsic Value.
* **Explanation:** Something has intrinsic value if it is good in and of itself, not because of what it produces. For many philosophers, pleasure is considered an intrinsic value.

**18. What type of value depends on some factor external to it?**
* **Answer:** Extrinsic Value.
* **Explanation:** The value of an object with extrinsic value is dependent on something outside of it, such as a beautiful painting's value depending on the appreciative reactions of viewers.

**19. What type of value is derived from what it brings about or its consequences?**
* **Answer:** Instrumental Value.
* **Explanation:** An object has instrumental value if it is useful as a means to achieve some other end. For example, a hammer has instrumental value for building things.

**20. Which conception of "The Good" consists of an individual's subjective states, such as pleasure or desire satisfaction?**
* **Answer:** Subjective.
* **Explanation:** Subjective conceptions of "the good" define it based on an individual's personal mental states, like feeling pleasure or having their desires satisfied.

**21. Which conception of "The Good" requires meeting a further standard beyond subjective states, such as acquiring genuine virtues?**
* **Answer:** Objective.
* **Explanation:** Objective conceptions of "the good" argue that true well-being requires meeting a standard beyond mere subjective feelings, such as developing and practicing virtues like courage and justice.

### **II. Ethical Lenses**

**22. What are rights defined as?**
* **Answer:** Entitlements or liberties.
* **Explanation:** The rights perspective defines rights as normative claims about what people are owed, which can be understood as entitlements or freedoms.

* **Answer:** Dignity and autonomy.
* **Explanation:** This lens is centered on the importance of respecting the inherent dignity and the capacity for self-governance (autonomy) of all individuals.

**24. Which perspective focuses on the distribution of benefits and burdens among stakeholders?**
* **Answer:** Justice.
* **Explanation:** The justice perspective is concerned with fairness in how benefits (like resources and opportunities) and burdens (like risks and costs) are distributed among people.

**25. According to the Justice perspective, why might treating people equally still be unfair?**
* **Answer:** Because some of them are very differently situated (e.g., more vulnerable) than others.
* **Explanation:** The justice lens recognizes that true fairness sometimes requires treating people unequally to account for pre-existing disadvantages or vulnerabilities.

**26. Which ethical lens focuses on the conditions required in order for all members of a society to flourish?**
* **Answer:** Common Good.
* **Explanation:** This approach evaluates actions and policies based on whether they contribute to creating a society where all members have the opportunity to thrive and live well.

**27. Which ethical lens focuses on the character traits (reflected in habits) that we deem good?**
* **Answer:** Virtue.
* **Explanation:** The virtue lens, or virtue ethics, centers on cultivating positive character traits, or virtues, in individuals and organizations.

**28. Which ethical lens asks how we might excel in fulfilling a particular role or relationship?**
* **Answer:** Virtue.
* **Explanation:** Virtue ethics is concerned with how a person can be excellent in their various roles (e.g., as a friend, parent, or professional) through the development of virtuous habits.

**29. Which ethical lens is rooted in relationships and in the need to listen and respond to individuals in their specific circumstances?**
* **Answer:** Care Ethics.
* **Explanation:** Care ethics prioritizes the importance of relationships and the specific context of a situation, emphasizing empathy and responsiveness to the needs of others.

**30. What three elements of stakeholders does Care ethics consider?**
* **Answer:** Feelings, concerns, and relationships.
* **Explanation:** This ethical lens requires taking into account the emotions, specific worries, and interpersonal connections of all stakeholders involved in a decision.

**31. The question, "How can we create the conditions required in order for all members of a society to flourish?" aligns with which lens?**
* **Answer:** Common Good.
* **Explanation:** This question is the central inquiry of the common good approach, focusing on societal well-being.

**32. The question, "How can we best protect and respect the moral rights of those affected?" aligns with which lens?**
* **Answer:** Rights.
* **Explanation:** This is the key question for the rights-based perspective, which prioritizes the protection of individual entitlements.

**33. The question, "How might our personal relationships, social practices, and political institutions be more caring?" aligns with which lens?**
* **Answer:** Care Ethics.
* **Explanation:** This question directly reflects the goal of care ethics, which is to infuse relationships and societal structures with more compassion and responsiveness.

### **III. Utilitarianism and Consequentialism**

**34. Utilitarianism is a prominent example of which kind of moral theory?**
* **Answer:** Teleological theory (or Consequentialism).
* **Explanation:** Utilitarianism is a teleological (goal-oriented) theory because it determines the rightness of an action based on its consequences, specifically its ability to promote a certain good (happiness). All teleological theories are forms of consequentialism.

**35. Teleological theories define what first?**
* **Answer:** The good.
* **Explanation:** Teleological theories, such as utilitarianism, first establish what is intrinsically good (e.g., pleasure, happiness) and then define right actions as those that maximize that good. This is in contrast to deontological theories, which define the right independently of the good.

**36. What is the Core Principle of utilitarianism articulated as bringing about?**
* **Answer:** The "greatest good for the greatest number".
* **Explanation:** This phrase is the classic summary of the utilitarian principle, which states that the right action is the one that produces the best overall outcome for the largest number of people affected.

**37. What is the "good" to be maximised in classical utilitarianism generally defined as?**
* **Answer:** Pleasure and the absence of pain (hedonism).
* **Explanation:** Classical utilitarianism is hedonistic, meaning it identifies the ultimate good with pleasure and the absence of pain. Therefore, a right action is one that maximizes the net balance of pleasure over pain.

**38. What key aspect of utilitarian calculation ensures everyone counts equally?**
* **Answer:** Impartiality.
* **Explanation:** A core requirement of utilitarianism is impartiality, where each person's happiness is given equal weight in the calculation of the overall good. As Bentham stated, "everyone is to count for one, and no one for more than one".

**39. Which early figure defended the utilitarian doctrine based on sentimentalist meta-ethics, alongside David Hume?**
* **Answer:** Francis Hutcheson.
* **Explanation:** In the 18th century, both Francis Hutcheson and David Hume argued for utilitarian principles, believing that our "moral sense" or feelings of sympathy naturally approve of actions that promote the greatest total good.

**40. What type of utilitarianism requires the agent to strive for the greatest overall happiness in every specific action?**
* **Answer:** Direct Utilitarianism (or Act Utilitarianism).
* **Explanation:** Act utilitarianism applies the principle of utility directly to each individual act, judging it based on its specific consequences.

**41. What is Direct Utilitarianism also known as?**
* **Answer:** Act Utilitarianism.
* **Explanation:** These two terms are used interchangeably to describe the same approach to applying the utility principle.

**42. What type of utilitarianism achieves desirable consequences by following general rules?**
* **Answer:** Indirect Utilitarianism (or Rule Utilitarianism).
* **Explanation:** Rule utilitarianism argues that overall happiness is maximized not by judging individual acts, but by adhering to a set of rules that, if followed by everyone, would lead to the best consequences.

**43. What is Indirect Utilitarianism also known as?**
* **Answer:** Rule Utilitarianism.
* **Explanation:** These two terms are used interchangeably to refer to the same rule-based approach.

**44. Which philosopher believed that overall utility is maximised when society relies on non-utilitarian "secondary principles"?**
* **Answer:** John Stuart Mill.
* **Explanation:** Mill argued that in everyday life, people should follow established moral rules (secondary principles), like keeping promises, because these rules have been shown over time to promote general happiness. One should only appeal directly to the principle of utility in cases where these secondary rules conflict.

**45. What type of hedonism focuses solely on the amount or duration of pleasure?**
* **Answer:** Quantitative Hedonism.
* **Explanation:** This view treats all pleasures as the same type of sensation, differing only in measurable quantities like intensity and duration.

**46. Which philosopher explicitly advocated for quantitative hedonism as the only sound basis for moral rightness?**
* **Answer:** Henry Sidgwick.
* **Explanation:** Sidgwick was a major defender of quantitative hedonism, arguing that it was the only coherent basis for a utilitarian theory. Jeremy Bentham is also famously associated with this view.

**47. What type of hedonism posits that some pleasures are inherently higher in quality than others?**
* **Answer:** Qualitative Hedonism.
* **Explanation:** This view, proposed to counter criticisms of utilitarianism, distinguishes between "higher" (intellectual, moral, aesthetic) pleasures and "lower" (sensual) pleasures, arguing the former are intrinsically better regardless of quantity.

**48. Which philosopher proposed qualitative hedonism?**
* **Answer:** John Stuart Mill.
* **Explanation:** Mill is famous for introducing qualitative hedonism, arguing it is "better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied" because humans can experience higher-quality pleasures.

**49. What concept did Henry Sidgwick famously articulate regarding the potential conflict between rational egoism and utilitarianism?**
* **Answer:** The "dualism of practical reason".
* **Explanation:** Sidgwick identified a deep and possibly unresolvable tension between the demands of rational self-interest (egoism) and the impartial demands of maximizing the overall good (utilitarianism).

**50. What does the utilitarian perspective seek to maximize besides overall well-being?**
* **Answer:** Aggregate happiness.
* **Explanation:** The goal of the utilitarian lens is to quantify and maximize the total or aggregate happiness and well-being for everyone affected by a decision.

### **IV. Deontological Ethics**

**51. Deontological theories define the right independently of what?**
* **Answer:** The good.
* **Explanation:** Unlike teleological theories that define right as what promotes the good, deontological theories assert that certain actions are intrinsically right or wrong based on rules or duties, regardless of their consequences.

**52. Deontology focuses on what two concepts as central to determining the rightness of actions?**
* **Answer:** Duty and moral obligation.
* **Explanation:** Deontology is a duty-based ethical framework where the core of morality lies in fulfilling one's duties and moral obligations.

**53. What kind of 'ought' do deontological theories often posit?**
* **Answer:** A categorical 'ought'.
* **Explanation:** This means that the moral command ('ought') is absolute and unconditional; it applies to all rational beings regardless of their personal desires or goals. This is a central feature of Kant's ethics.

**54. What is the Core Principle of Kant's ethics, which a morally worthy action must align with?**
* **Answer:** The Categorical Imperative.
* **Explanation:** For Kant, the Categorical Imperative is the supreme, universal principle of morality from which all duties are derived.

**55. What is Kant's "universal law" formulation associated with?**
* **Answer:** The Categorical Imperative.
* **Explanation:** One of the main formulations of the Categorical Imperative is to "act only on maxims that one could rationally will to be a universal law".

**56. According to Kant, persons are to be treated as what, not merely as means to an end?**
* **Answer:** Ends in themselves.
* **Explanation:** This is another key formulation of the Categorical Imperative, known as the "respect for persons" principle. It states that we must treat all rational beings as having intrinsic worth, not just as tools for our own purposes.

**57. What term describes the will when it is driven by external factors like inclinations?**
* **Answer:** Heteronomy.
* **Explanation:** A heteronomous will is one whose principles of action are determined by something outside of its own reason, such as desires, emotions, or external authority.

**58. What term describes the will when it is guided by morality and gives the law to itself?**
* **Answer:** Autonomy.
* **Explanation:** An autonomous will is self-legislating; it acts on principles that it gives to itself through reason, free from external determinations.

**59. What is the core principle of W. D. Ross's deontology?**
* **Answer:** The right action is the action that best accords with the fulfillment and/or non-violation of one's *prima facie* duties.
* **Explanation:** Ross believed we have multiple, self-evident duties (like fidelity and gratitude) that are binding "at first glance." When these duties conflict, we must use our judgment to determine our actual duty in that specific situation.

**60. What are duties that are obligatory "unless there is some countervailing consideration" called?**
* **Answer:** *Prima facie* duties.
* **Explanation:** A *prima facie* duty is a genuine moral obligation that holds unless it is overridden by a stronger moral obligation in a particular context.

**61. Ross's approach is what, recognizing multiple, distinct ultimate moral principles?**
* **Answer:** Pluralist.
* **Explanation:** Ross's theory is pluralistic because it rejects the idea of a single, overarching moral principle (like the Categorical Imperative or the Principle of Utility) and instead posits several distinct, fundamental duties.

**62. Contractualism, as defined by T. M. Scanlon, concerns actions forbidden by principles that rational persons could not reasonably do what to?**
* **Answer:** Reject.
* **Explanation:** Scanlon's contractualism frames morality around justifiability to others. An act is wrong if it would be forbidden by a set of principles for the general regulation of behavior that no one, motivated to find such principles, could reasonably reject.

**63. Contractualism emphasizes a mutual recognition of what we owe to each other as what kind of beings?**
* **Answer:** Rational beings.
* **Explanation:** The theory is built on the foundation of what rational beings, in a position of mutual recognition, owe to one another in terms of justification for their actions.

**64. What type of theory requires value to be honoured or respected (e.g., respect for rational nature)?**
* **Answer:** Deontological Theories.
* **Explanation:** While consequentialist theories command us to *promote* value (maximize the good), deontological theories often command us to *honor* or *respect* value, such as Kant's injunction to respect the rational nature of persons.

### **V. Virtue Ethics**

**65. Virtue Ethics primarily focuses on what type of evaluation?**
* **Answer:** Character evaluation.
* **Explanation:** Unlike theories that focus on the rightness of individual actions, virtue ethics' primary concern is the moral character of the agent.

**66. What is the central question asked by Virtue Ethics?**
* **Answer:** "What sort of person should I be?".
* **Explanation:** This question shifts the focus from actions ("What should I do?") to being ("What kind of person should I become?"), emphasizing personal development and moral character.

**67. What Greek term meaning "goodness" or "excellence" refers to qualities that make someone admirable?**
* **Answer:** *Aretê*.
* **Explanation:** *Aretê* is the Greek word for virtue or excellence. It refers to the qualities, such as bravery and justice, that make a person good and their life admirable.

**68. What Greek term is often translated as "flourishing," representing the ultimate good a human being aims for?**
* **Answer:** *Eudaimonia*.
* **Explanation:** *Eudaimonia* is the ultimate goal in ancient Greek ethics, representing a state of living well, thriving, and achieving human excellence. It is more comprehensive than the modern concept of "happiness".

**69. What intellectual virtue enables a person to deliberate well about "living well as a whole"?**
* **Answer:** Practical Reason (*Phronêsis*).
* **Explanation:** *Phronêsis*, often translated as practical wisdom or prudence, is the crucial intellectual virtue that allows a person to understand what is good in a particular situation and to act accordingly.

**70. Who argued that knowledge is sufficient for virtue and virtue is sufficient for happiness?**
* **Answer:** Socrates.
* **Explanation:** These are two of Socrates's central and most debated claims. He believed that if one truly knows what is right, they will do it, and that living a virtuous life is all one needs to be truly happy.

**71. Plato argued that virtue requires the cooperation of which parts of the soul?**
* **Answer:** The rational and non-rational parts of the soul (reason, spirit, appetite).
* **Explanation:** Plato rejected Socrates's intellectualism, arguing that virtue is not just knowledge but a state of harmony where the rational part of the soul guides the spirited and appetitive parts.

**72. What state involves a well-ordered soul with reason controlling non-rational desires, according to Plato?**
* **Answer:** Virtue.
* **Explanation:** For Plato, virtue is synonymous with a healthy, well-ordered soul, which he argued is intrinsically beneficial and leads to the agent's own happiness.

**73. Aristotle defined Happiness (*Eudaimonia*) as activity that exercises what well?**
* **Answer:** Practical reason.
* **Explanation:** Aristotle's formal definition of *Eudaimonia* is an activity of the soul in accordance with complete virtue over a full life. This activity is fundamentally about exercising our rational capacities excellently.

**74. Aristotle's Virtue of Character is a state involving election, lying in a mean, and defined by what?**
* **Answer:** Reason (prudence).
* **Explanation:** This is Aristotle's famous definition of a moral virtue. It is a disposition to choose the "mean" (the appropriate response between extremes of excess and deficiency), as determined by the person with practical wisdom (*phronêsis*).

**75. According to Aristotle, for whose sake are virtuous actions chosen?**
* **Answer:** For the sake of the fine (*kalon*).
* **Explanation:** A virtuous person chooses virtuous actions for their own sake—because they are noble, fine, and beautiful. This promotes a common good, not just the agent's narrow self-interest.

**76. What is a right action understood as, according to virtue ethics?**
* **Answer:** The action that a virtuous person would characteristically perform in the circumstances.
* **Explanation:** Virtue ethics defines right action by referring to the model of a fully virtuous person. The right thing to do is whatever such a person would do.

**77. Which school of thought identified happiness with virtue, viewing it as the only good?**
* **Answer:** The Stoics.
* **Explanation:** The Stoics held the strong view that virtue is the only thing that is truly good, and that external factors like health or wealth have no bearing on one's true happiness. Therefore, virtue is sufficient for happiness.

**78. Who integrated Aristotelian ethics and held that moral virtues partially constitute happiness?**
* **Answer:** Aquinas.
* **Explanation:** St. Thomas Aquinas synthesized Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology. He adopted Aristotle's framework but argued that while moral virtues are a necessary part of earthly happiness, ultimate happiness is found in union with God.

**79. What are the stable dispositions and traits that define a person's moral identity?**
* **Answer:** Character.
* **Explanation:** This is the definition of character within virtue ethics. Virtues are the excellent dispositions that make up a good moral character.

### **VI. Personal, Professional, and Social Ethics**

**80. What type of ethics involves individual values, workplace conduct, and societal norms, respectively?**
* **Answer:** Personal, Professional, and Social ethics.
* **Explanation:** This question defines the three distinct but interconnected domains of applied ethics: the individual (personal), the workplace (professional), and the community (social).

**81. Which type of ethics is self-driven and internalized rather than coming from external codes of conduct?**
* **Answer:** Personal ethics.

**86. Professional ethics are regulated by standards often referred to as what?**
* **Answer:** Codes of ethics.
* **Explanation:** Professional communities adopt sets of standards, often called codes of ethics or codes of conduct, to provide boundaries and regulate the behavior of their members.

**87. What is integrity regarded as in ethics?**
* **Answer:** The honesty and truthfulness or accuracy of one's actions.
* **Explanation:** Integrity is the quality of having consistency between one's actions, values, and principles. It is fundamentally about being honest and truthful.

**88. What is integrity regarded as the opposite of?**
